## Abstract
In an AI-dominated world, distinguishing human-created content from machine-generated is crucial. ByHuman leverages Ethereum and ENS for privacy-friendly, decentralized proof-of-human authorship. Creators use self-sovereign ENS domains to sign and verify works cryptographically, resisting Sybil attacks via community vouching and economic incentives. This promotes transparency, user control, and the value of human creativity.

## The Problem
AI generates realistic text, images, music, and code, flooding markets and eroding trust. Existing solutions (biometrics, centralized verifications) raise privacy concerns, ethical issues, and scalability problems. We need a decentralized, pseudonymous way to prove human origin without compromising data.

## The Solution: ByHuman Core Principles
1. **Self-Sovereign Identity via ENS:** Users claim unique domains like `human01.eth` as identity anchors.
2. **Decentralized Verification:** Community-driven vouching + deposits prevent multiples; no biometrics needed.
3. **Proof-of-Creation:** Cryptographic signatures or SBTs/NFTs link content to verified humans.
4. **Integrations:** Seamless with Web3 (Sign-In with Ethereum) and Web2 via APIs.

For technical details, see the whitepaper sections on architecture, registration, and proof mechanisms.

## Owned ENS Domains for Sale/Partnership
I own these premium ENS domains, ideal for building ByHuman. Open to selling or partnering with investors/developers to develop the protocol and launch. Contact me via GitHub Issues or [byhuman@proton.me].

These domains are registered on Ethereum and transferable. Serious inquiries only – let's build this together!

## Market Potential & Incentives for Investors
- **Market Size:** AI content market >$100B by 2025; proof-of-human could capture 5-10% (e.g., via tokens, fees).
- **Monetization:** Token incentives, domain sales, premium verifications.
- **Why Invest?** Scalable to millions; aligns with Web3 trends (ENS, SBTs). Early movers gain network effects.
- **Call to Action:** Fork this repo, contribute code (e.g., smart contracts), or fund development.

## Technical Roadmap (For Developers/Nerds)
1. **Phase 1:** Deploy registrar smart contract for domain claims.
2. **Phase 2:** Implement vouching/challenge mechanics (using Kleros for arbitration).
3. **Phase 3:** Build signing tools (e.g., browser extension for hash+sign).
4. **Tech Stack:** Solidity (contracts), ENS.js (integration), IPFS (content hashing).

Contribute: Open Issues for discussions, PRs for code. We need Solidity experts, frontend devs (React), and crypto economists.
